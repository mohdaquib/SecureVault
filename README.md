## 🔐 Security Highlights

### Encrypted Storage
- SQLCipher encrypts the database
- Encryption key is randomly generated
- Key is encrypted using Android Keystore
- Instrumentation test verifies no plaintext in DB file

### Network Security
- SSL certificate pinning using SPKI hashes
- Pinning enforced at runtime
- MockWebServer tests validate pin success & failure
